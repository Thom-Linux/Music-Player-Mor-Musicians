# Music-Player-For-Musicians
This is a completely open-source project created by me, i don't have much experience, i'm 14 and i'm studying Python at school.
So if you want to help me with this project do it! It's completely open-source.
I called it "Music Player For Musicians" because i'm a bassist, and i need a good software to reproduce my music and my bands projects.


Version 0.1:
[Music Player for Musicians | v0.1.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24367124/Music.Player.for.Musicians.v0.1.py)

This is the first version of the software, it supports .mp3, .ogg, .flac, .wav type of files, but you can easely add a file extension.
It has a very basic GUI.
If you find a bug make me know or solve it.


Version 0.2 (Beta):
[Music Player for Musicians | v0.2.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24367160/Music.Player.for.Musicians.v0.2.py)

This is the second version of the software, it adds support for .opus files, and it has a less basic GUI with a volume slider.
It has a bug: when you start the program it opens another window called "tk".
For the v0.2 stable i'm working on this bug.
