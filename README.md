# Music-Player-For-Musicians
This is a completely open-source project created by me, i don't have much experience, i'm 14 and i'm studying Python at school.
So if you want to help me with this project do it! It's completely open-source.
I called it "Music Player For Musicians" because i'm a bassist, and i need a good software to reproduce my music and my bands projects.
